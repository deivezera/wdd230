      <p>White space is being used in this website to give focus on the main character from apple, the iphone. They give a lot of space to focus on their product and the slogan. It doesn't need anything else than the slogan, the cellphone picture and the description and price. The white space works to focus only in that information and nothing else.</p>

      <div class="border">

      </div>
      <p>Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance. LVMH does it by focusing on their typographies. They first give focus to the phrase "The show room", then there's a brief description in a small typography and then a very elegant button to "start your journey" invinting people to click it. there's a hierarchy to be followed there to get the users attention.</p>
